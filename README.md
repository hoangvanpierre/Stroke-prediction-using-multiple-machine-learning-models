# Stroke-prediction-using-multiple-machine-learning-models
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. In this study, i will apply multiple machine learning models to predict stroke risk, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
