# Stroke-prediction-using-multiple-machine-learning-models
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.. In this study, i will apply multiple machine learning models to predict stroke risk, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

This paper addresses the issue of stroke, one of the major challenges in the healthcare field, and focuses on developing a stroke prediction model using machine learning methods. Stroke is becoming an increasingly important public health threat, and the ability to predict risks before they occur can help minimize the impact and provide effective treatment solutions.
With the continuous development of medicine and technology, the use of machine learning to predict and prevent stroke is becoming increasingly feasible. We will introduce the important context of stroke, especially its significant impact on public health.
In this section, we will also describe in detail the model building process, starting from data analysis, preprocessing, to model training and evaluation of results. Machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, will be applied and the effectiveness of each method will be discussed.
Our goal is not only to build a model that can accurately predict stroke, but also to convey the importance of applying machine learning in the medical field. We hope that this report will bring insight and awareness to the applicability of the technology in improving prediction and healthcare for the community.

We will compare the accuracy results of all the models used and built in the project:

Based on the classification results of the models, the following conclusions can be drawn:

• General classification results:

The classification results of the models show that they have good performance in classifying the cases. The overall accuracy of the models ranges from 76.3% to 99.49%. The highest is Random Forest with an accuracy of 99.49%.

The lowest is Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 76.3%

• Detailed classification results:

The detailed classification results of the models show that they have high precision and recall for both classes. This shows that the models can effectively distinguish between the two classes and collect all relevant stroke and non-stroke cases.

• Overall Conclusion:

Overall, the image classification models perform well in classifying instances. The models can be used to classify instances with high accuracy and confidence. However, the models can be further improved by using overfitting mitigation techniques.
